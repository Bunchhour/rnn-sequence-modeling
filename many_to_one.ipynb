         "Petter Mattei's \"Love in the Time of Money\" is a visually stunning film to watch. Mr. Mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations. This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money, power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter. <br /><br />This being a variation on the Arthur Schnitzler's play about the same theme, the director transfers the action to the present time New York where all these different characters meet and connect. Each one is connected in one way, or another to the next person, but no one seems to know the previous point of contact. Stylishly, the film has a sophisticated luxurious look. We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat.<br /><br />The only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits. A big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment, as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter.<br /><br />The acting is good under Mr. Mattei's direction. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier, and the rest of the talented cast, make these characters come alive.<br /><br />We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work.",

I am still a practicing Catholic but would not be considered a \"good Catholic\" in the church\\'s eyes because I don\\'t believe certain things or act certain ways just because the church tells me to.<br /><br />So back to the movie...its bad because two people are killed by this nun who is supposed to be a satire as the embodiment of a female religious figurehead. There is no comedy in that and the satire is not done well by the over acting of Diane Keaton. I never saw the play but if it was very different from this movies then it may be good.<br /><br />At first I thought the gun might be a fake and the first shooting all a plan by the female lead of the four former students as an attempt to demonstrate Sister Mary\\'s emotional and intellectual bigotry of faith.

This is a second rate, excessively vicious Western that creaks and groans trying to put across its central theme of the Wild West being tamed and kicked aside by the steady march of time. It would like to be in the tradition of \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\", but lacks that film\\'s poignancy and charm. Andrew McLaglen\\'s direction is limp, and the final 30 minutes or so are a real botch, with some incomprehensible strategy on the part of heroes Charlton Heston and Chris Mitchum. (Someone give me a holler if you can explain to me why they set that hillside on fire.) There was something callous about the whole treatment of the rape scene, and the woman\\'s reaction afterwards certainly did not ring true. Coburn is plenty nasty as the half breed escaped convict out for revenge, but all of his fellow escapees are underdeveloped (they\\'re like bowling pins to be knocked down one by one as the story lurches forward). Michael Parks gives one of his typically shifty, lethargic, mumbling performances, but in this case it was appropriate as his modern style sheriff symbolizes the complacency that technological progress can bring about.'\n",

Unfortunately, this movie had a muddled, implausible plot that just left me cringing - this is by far the worst of the nine (so far) movies. Even the chance to watch the well known characters interact in another movie can't save this movie - including the goofy scenes with Kirk, Spock and McCoy at Yosemite.<br /><br />I would say this movie is not worth a rental, and hardly worth watching, however for the True Fan who needs to see all the movies, renting this movie is about the only way you'll see it - even the cable channels avoid this movie.\"]\n"

    "## 🤔 Answers to Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❓ Why are reviews converted to numbers?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "- **Neural networks only understand numbers**, not text\n",
    "- Each word gets a unique integer ID (word → number mapping)\n",
    "- Creates a mathematical representation that models can learn from\n",
    "- Enables embedding layers to learn vector representations of words\n",
    "- Words with similar meanings will have similar learned embeddings\n",
    "- **Example**: \n",
    "  - \"amazing\" → 245\n",
    "  - \"excellent\" → 187\n",
    "  - \"terrible\" → 89\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❓ Why do we pad sequences?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "- **PyTorch requires fixed-length inputs** for efficient batch processing\n",
    "- Reviews have varying lengths (10 words vs 500 words)\n",
    "- Padding adds `<PAD>` tokens (zeros) to make all sequences equal length\n",
    "- **Post-padding** (zeros at end) preserves the actual content at the start\n",
    "- Enables parallel processing of multiple reviews in batches\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Review A: [45, 23, 67]          → [45, 23, 67, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "  Review B: [12, 89, 34, 56, 78]  → [12, 89, 34, 56, 78, 0, 0]\n",
